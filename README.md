- 👋 Hi, I’m @TicklesMyBrain. Many call me "KE"
- 👀 I’m interested in nonprofits, non-governmental organizations, project support, diversity, and a resuce cat named Hope
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, Google AppScript, and my personal superpower
- 💞️ I’m super new to this space so not adding much value YET. Would love to tag along and learn from others.
- 📫 How to reach me best is via Facebook/Facebook Messenger - https://www.facebook.com/kimberly.elyse.50/
